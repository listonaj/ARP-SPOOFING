#To execute the urlsnarf command with the -i eth0 option, you can use Python's subprocess module. 
# Make sure the dsniff package is installed on your system, as urlsnarf is part of that package. 
# Here's a Python script to execute the command:

import subprocess

interface = "eth0"  # Change this to the appropriate network interface

def execute_urlsnarf(interface):
    try:
        # Build the urlsnarf command
        command = ["urlsnarf", "-i", interface]

        # Execute the urlsnarf command
        subprocess.run(command, check=True)

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

execute_urlsnarf(interface)
